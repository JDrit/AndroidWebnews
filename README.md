AndroidWebnews
==============

An android application to read CSH WebNews on the phone.

This uses the WebNews API to interface with the N.N.T.P. server. This is done so that the app will
 mirror the status of the website. This application uses https get, post, and put request to do all
 of the updating so it will not work with any N.N.T.P. server unless it is also running WebNews
 (https://github.com/grantovich/CSH-WebNews).

 The application is on the google play market at:
